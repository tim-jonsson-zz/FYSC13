We use jupyter notebook for the lab. 

A. If you use the computer in H321, download the "ini.bash" file and put it in the folder ~/Downloads. Start the terminal window by Ctrl+Alt+T, run the following line by line:

	cd ~/Downloads
	chmod u+x ini.bash
	./ini.bash
	source ~/.bashrc
	conda install -p ~/Documents/FYSC13/Phonon-labs -c conda-forge ffmpeg
	jupyter notebook


B. If you want to use your own laptop, you need to install anaconda and several packages.
B.1 For Windows or macOS system, visit:

	https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

and download the python 3.7 version. After installation, start anaconda and run the following:

	conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
	conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg

Then go to the github page and download the codes for the lab. In anaconda, move to the directory where you put the codes and run:

	jupyter notebook

B.2 For Linux system, download the "download.bash" and "launch.bash" files and put them in the folder ~/Downloads. Start the terminal window by Ctrl+Alt+T, run the following line by line:

	cd ~/Downloads
	chmod u+x download.bash
	chmod u+x launch.bash
